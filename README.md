# Android Project

This is an android project I did for the course of android in my undergrad.

This uses firebase but unsure if it still holds. There are some minor problems.
This app is intended for the people of Dhaka city to know the wheareabouts of the different Events taking place throughout the city.
But it needs constant monitor and updating because the data is not automatic.

This was also done a long time back but feel free to tweak it and add as much as you can.
